# This is a basic app, which lets you:
   Choose a file or a bunch of exe files;
   Display their path to an autogenerated text file and to the GUI.
 When the app is closed, the selected exe files will be written in the txt file and when the app is opened again you could still see them on the GUI and execute them.
